What's Markdown (`.md`)?

Markdown is markup that lets you write hypertext (HTML) documents
in easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text.
No angle brackets `<></>` required for
paragraphs, lists, blockquotes, tables, etc.


This is a paragraph (in Markdown). Some more
text here.

This is another paragraph.

This is a list:

- Orange
- Apple
- Blueberry

$$x^2 = y^2$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(\pmb{y},\pmb{\hat{y}})=\sum_{i=0}^n\sum_{j=0}^m\textit{H}(y_{ij},\hat{y}_{ij})
\end{aligned}
$$
